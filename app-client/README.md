# Grooming Salon Project

## About the Project:
This project provides a platform to create and manage appointments as well as customer data specifically for a grooming salon but can be modified to accommodate other services that provide appointment-based customer service.


## This project was completed with the the following goals in mind: 
 - Create a multi-components React-based front-end application
 - Set up a Ruby back-end server 
 - Persist data in a database with ActiveRecord support
 - Provide API routing using Sinatra

 ## Getting Started:
- Clone the repository [git@github.com:your-name/grooming-salon.git]
- run ### `npm install` to install front-end dependencies
- run ### `bundle install` to install back-end dependencies
- run ### `rake db:migrate db:seed` to create the database tables and add test data
- run ### `rake server` to start the database server
- run ### `npm start` to start the app server

## Usage:
